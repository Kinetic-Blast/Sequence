# Hash-Based Virus Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

**Name:** Sequence  
**Objective:** Create a tool that uses file hashes like DNA sequences to analyze viruses, allowing users to upload files, compute hashes for lines or chunks, and compare them against known malware samples.

## Key Features

1. **Upload Files**: User-friendly interface for file uploads.
2. **Hashing**: Compute MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 for each file line/chunk.
3. **Database**: Stores known malware hashes.
4. **Comparison**: Compares file hashes against the malware database.
5. **API Access**: Provides API for automated uploads and hash comparison.

## System Components

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Vue).
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) to handle uploads, compute hashes, and compare against the database.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing file and malware hashes.

## Workflow

1. **Upload**: File sent to the backend.
2. **Hash Calculation**: Backend reads and hashes file content.
3. **Comparison**: Compares hashes against malware database.
4. **Result Display**: Shows matches and details in the UI.

## API Endpoints

1. **POST /upload**: Uploads files for hash calculation.
2. **GET /results/{file_id}**: Retrieves hash and comparison results.
3. **GET /malware_samples**: Lists malware samples.

## Security

- **File Validation**: Ensure safe processing.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse.
- **Data Privacy**: Secure file storage and handling.
- **Authentication**: Manage access with API keys.

## Future Enhancements

1. **More Hash Algorithms**: Extend to SHA-512, Blake2, etc.
2. **Fuzzy Hashing & Entropy Analysis**: Advanced comparison techniques.
3. **User Profiles**: Save and track user history.
4. **Collaborative Database**: Allow users to contribute new malware samples.

## Evolutionary "DNA" Concept for Malware

1. **Fingerprinting**: Hash code segments as unique markers.
2. **Evolution Tree**: Map malware evolution like a phylogenetic tree.
3. **Sequence Alignment**: Use DNA-like alignment for code similarity.
4. **Visualization**: Show malware evolution with interactive graphs.

This approach allows deeper insights into malware evolution, enhancing both detection and analysis.
